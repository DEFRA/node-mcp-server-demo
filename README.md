## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd node-mcp-server-demo
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory.

```bash
touch .env
```

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

To test the application run:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

## Development helpers

### MongoDB Locks

If you require a write lock for Mongo you can acquire it via `server.locker` or `request.locker`:

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  const lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  try {
    // do stuff
  } finally {
    await lock.free()
  }
}
```

Keep it small and atomic.

You may use **using** for the lock resource management.
Note test coverage reports do not like that syntax.

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  await using lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  // do stuff

  // lock automatically released
}
```

Helper methods are also available in `/src/helpers/mongo-lock.js`.
